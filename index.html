        Technology is the practical application of scientific knowledge to solve problems, create tools, and make human life more efficient and
        convenient. From the wheel and fire of ancient times to modern advancements like artificial intelligence and the internet, technology 
        has been a consistent driver of human progress. It encompasses a vast range of inventions, from physical machines like computers and
        medical devices to intangible ones like software and advanced techniques. The influence of technology is woven into every aspect of
        our lives, transforming communication, transportation, healthcare, and education. While it offers immense benefits, such as enhanced
        productivity and global connectivity, it also presents complex challenges like data privacy
        concerns and potential job displacement. Therefore, technology represents a double-edged sword that requires careful and responsible use.
