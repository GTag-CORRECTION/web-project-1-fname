      Games originated in the ancient need for play, skill development, 
      and social bonding, with roots stretching back thousands of years. 
      The earliest board games, such as the 5,000-year-old Egyptian game 
      of Senet and the Royal Game of Ur from Mesopotamia, were played with 
      carved stones and boards. These early forms of play evolved alongside 
      human society, with different cultures developing their own unique games, 
      including dice games, card games from ancient China, and ball games with 
      religious significance like the Mesoamerican ballgame. As human civilization 
      advanced, so did games. In medieval Europe, board games and outdoor contests 
      became popular among both royalty and common people. By the industrial age, mass 
      production made commercial board games, like "The Mansion of Happiness," accessible 
      to a wider audience, though they often carried moralistic messages. The true explosion 
      of games came with the electronic age. In the mid-20th century, early computer scientists 
      developed simple electronic games, like William Higinbotham's "Tennis for Two" in 1958, 
      primarily for academic research and tech demonstrations. These innovations eventually led 
      to the commercial video game industry in the 1970s, forever changing the landscape of play.
